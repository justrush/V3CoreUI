# Steps taken

## 1- Install and configure the Amplify CLI
### link: https://docs.amplify.aws/start/getting-started/installation/q/integration/react#option-2-follow-the-instructions 

### 1.1 Install Amplify CLI
### $ npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli 
### Note: Because we’re installing the Amplify CLI globally, you might need to run the command above with sudo depending on your system policies. The above installs the CLI.

###1.2 Configure Amplify CLI
### $ amplify configure
### Note: Configure Amplify by running the following command above. Once you’re signed in, Amplify CLI will ask you to create an IAM user.Amazon IAM (Identity and Access Management) enables you to manage users and user permissions in AWS. 
### Note: Create a user with AdministratorAccess to your account to provision AWS resources for you like AppSync, Cognito etc.
### Note: Once the user is created, Amplify CLI will ask you to provide the accessKeyId and the secretAccessKey to connect Amplify CLI with your newly created IAM user.

## 2- Create CoreUI React.js application
### link to create only a react.js app: https://docs.amplify.aws/start/getting-started/setup/q/integration/react#create-a-new-react-app
### link to Core.Ui React.js main branch: 

### 2.1 Clone the repo
### $ git clone https://github.com/coreui/coreui-free-react-admin-template.git my-project
### Note: Can replace my-project with whatever you want. This can also be done by going in VSCode and clone repo through application.

### 2.2 Navigate and open app's directory
### $ cd my-project

### 2.3 Install app's dependencies
### $ npm install

### 2.4 Test locally
### $ npm start
### Note: takes a moment, but should eventually open on: http://localhost:3000/



## 3- Initialize Amplify backend
### Navigate to app’s directory and initialize Amplify backend
### $ amplify init

### Note: When you initialize a new Amplify project, a few things happen: (1) It creates a top level directory called amplify that stores your backend definition. During the tutorial you’ll add capabilities such as a GraphQL API and authentication. As you add features, the amplify folder will grow with infrastructure-as-code templates that define your backend stack. Infrastructure-as-code is a best practice way to create a replicable backend stack. (2) It creates a file called aws-exports.js in the src directory that holds all the configuration for the services you create with Amplify. This is how the Amplify client is able to get the necessary information about your backend services. (3) It modifies the .gitignore file, adding some generated files to the ignore list. (4) A cloud project is created for you in the AWS Amplify Console that can be accessed by running amplify console. The Console provides a list of backend environments, deep links to provisioned resources per Amplify category, status of recent deployments, and instructions on how to promote, clone, pull, and delete backend resources

## 4- Install Amplify backend
### Navigate to app’s directory and install libraries
### $ npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-react

### Note: The aws-amplify package is the main library for working with Amplify in your apps. The @aws-amplify/ui-react package includes React specific UI components we’ll use as we build the app.


## 5- Set up Front end for Amplify
### 5.1Open src/index.js and add the following code below the last import

### import Amplify from "aws-amplify";
### import awsExports from "./aws-exports";
### Amplify.configure(awsExports);

## 5.1 Save files
### Ensure to save code updates
### Then go through the sequence to ensure it is all  saved locally:
### $ git init
### $ git add .
### $ git commit -m “initial commit”

## 6- Create Repository in Git Hub (GH)
### 6.1- Log onto GH
### 6.2- Go to Repositories page
### 6.3- Click new, name repository, and click create repository
### 6.4- Create Build dir in application ( $ npm run build )
### Note: this creates a /build folder and adds to .gitignore file
### 6.5- Save in VSCode, then $ git add . ; $ git commit -m “added build”
### 6.6- Push application to repository: 
### git remote add origin https://github.com/justrush/Testing.git
### git branch -M main
### git push -u origin main

##7- Add application to Amplify 
### 7.1 Go to Amplify console and click New App and Host web app
### 7.2 Select GH and click the newly created repository.
### 7.3 Wait for Amplify to pull everything in 

##8- Issues I faced
### Access was continually being denied; just like: https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-console/issues/436
### First tried the following: https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli/issues/5047 ; https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63546586/access-denied-error-from-protected-routes-from-react-app-hosted-on-aws-amplify 
### Solution: Many people stated that doing the rewrites and redirects would work.. never did, as many of those issues were relating to a node.js or vue.js app. However, found this solution: https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli/issues/5047  . All you have to do is-> Go to App Console, Build settings, Edit, and add /build to artifacts section, under baseDirectory. By default , baseDirectory: / , I changed it to baseDirectory: /build 
### Then go back to your makes some changes in your project in VSCode, do a commit in github, then the Amplify console will generate the build automatically and your project will run without any errors.. You do not need to add any Redirects and Rewrites for this, so if you tried that.. go back and delete them.
